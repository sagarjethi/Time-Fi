##  **Problem**

• Creators don't have any p2p platform where they can demonstrate their skills sets in a decentralised way. 

• All centralised platform has some bias-ness and operates under certainly limited regulation.

• Creators pay around 30% of the money to the payment processing and platform provider.

• Creator has to bear the charge of international txn fee.

• Creators economics are always dependent on country economics policy 

##  ****Solution****


A decentralised P2P platform to reduce the barrier between creator and consumer on Zil ecosystem.


• It will have the power to create its own token.

• Book time/slot of creators for a personalised session. Since every time is unique in itself , can be turned into NFT.

• Pay creator in their token.

• Bonding Curve makes the whole economics intresting.


Bonus: Creator token will be the function of the value they are putting in the ecosystem.

##  ****How it Works****


• Creator comes on TimeFi and login via Zilpay

• Creators create their own token.

• Creator give persmission for bonding curve .(Its optional)

• Creator list thier token on zil based DEX.

• User can buy those token from any exchange.

• User use the token to book calender appointment.

• Time slot will be booked for both creator and user.
